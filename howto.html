        <h1> How to use it?</h1>
        <p>
             To use Nintendo Wii Remotes, or any
        <a href="#devices">compatible device</a>, on linux, you need:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>linux kernel</strong> 3.1 or newer (<strong>3.11</strong>
              or newer recommended)</li>
          <li><strong>bluez</strong>-4.101 or newer (<strong>bluez-5.0</strong>
              or newer recommended)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>kernel drive</em>r is available since linux-3.1 upstream.
        However, you need at least <em>linux-3.11</em>
        for a hotplug-capable driver and proper device
        support. Older versions of the kernel driver are no longer recommended
        (still supported, but may lack important features). Most major
        distributions provide toose kernels out-of-the-box with the
        <strong>hid-wiimote</strong>
        driver enabled. But you might have to call
        <code>modprobe hid-wiimote</code>
        to load the driver manually.
        <br />
        The <em>bluez bluetooth stack</em> is the official linux bluetooth
        stack which
        is provided by all major distributions. Since <em>version 4.101</em>
        it includes
        fixes so Nintendo devices can be paired with linux hosts. If you use
        an older bluez version, you may still be able to use Nintendo
        Wii / Wii U devices, but you cannot pair them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you made sure you have the required software installed, you can
        start a bluetooth-manager of your choice (eg.,
        <a href="https://launchpad.net/blueman">blueman</a>,
        <a href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeBluetooth">gnome-bluetooth</a>)
        and perform a bluetooth inquiry (ie., search for nearby devices). Your
        remotes will show up as <strong>Nintendo RVL-CNT-01</strong>
        (<em>Revolution</em> was the codename of the Nintendo Wii) or with
        slightly modified names (eg., the balance board shows up as
        <strong>Nintendo RVL-WBC-01</strong>). Select a device and connect to
        it. If you use a new enough bluez version, it will automatically select
        the
        correct PIN. If you are prompted for PIN input, your bluez stack is too
        old. In this case simply select <em>"Connect without PIN"</em> or
        <em>"Connect without Pairing"</em> as you cannot enter the required PIN
        via these interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you connected a device, the <em>hid-wiimote</em> kernel driver
        will pick it up and provide kernel input interfaces for it. As these
        interfaces are pretty useless on its own, you need a user-space
        application or driver that uses the device. The kernel interfaces
        provide the parsed data input (eg., accelerometer data, IR cam
        positioning information, ...) but do not apply any policy. So if you
        want to use your device to emulate mouse-input, you need a user-space
        driver which does exactly that. There is no sane generic way how X11
        or other applications could use this data, as it is very device
        specific.
        <br />
        The <strong>xwiimote tools</strong> provide a library and some
        programs
        to help application-developers use Nintendo Wii / Wii U remotes.
        It is highly recommended to install the
        <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote">xwiimote-package</a>
        before using a device. It will install some X11 blacklists so your
        X-Server will not pick up those devices by default. It also provides
        a tool called <strong>xwiishow</strong>, which can be used for testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point on, there are several ways to use the device:
        <ul>
          <li>Use <a href="#xwiishow">xwiishow</a> for testing</li>
          <li>Install <a href="#x11">xf86-input-xwiimote</a> to make X11 use
              the device as input device</li>
          <li>Use the device with an application that supports
              <em>xwiimote</em></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        </p>
             <h3 id="xwiishow">xwiishow</h3>
      <p>
        Once you followed the instructions given above, you can use the
        <em>xwiishow</em> command-line program from the
        <em>xwiimote tools</em> project. Simply install the
        <a href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote">xwiimote-package</a>
        and run <code>xwiishow list</code>. This will list all currently
        connected devices. Via <code>xwiishow &lt;num&gt;</code> you can open
        a device and see a visualization of all input events. Several hotkeys
        are available to control the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        A manpage <em>xwiishow(1)</em> is also provided which explains all
        hotkeys and command-line arguments.
      </p>
<!--       <h3 id="x11">X11 Input Driver</h3> -->
      <p>
        The <strong>xf86-input-xwiimote</strong> project provides an X11
        input driver so a Nintendo Wii / Wii U device can be used as X11
        input device. The project is still under development, but currently
        supports emulating arbitrary button and keyboard input and emulating
        a mouse with the accelerometer and Motion-Plus gyroscope. Install the
        <a
href="http://github.com/dvdhrm/xf86-input-xwiimote">xf86-input-xwiimote</a>
        package and give it a try!
